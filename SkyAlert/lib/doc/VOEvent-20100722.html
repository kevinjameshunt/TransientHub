<h2><a id="abstract" name="abstract">Abstract</a></h2>
<p>
VOEvent [<a href="#voevent">21</a>]
defines the content and meaning of a standard information
packet for representing, transmitting, publishing and archiving 
information about a transient celestial event, with the implication that
timely follow-up is of interest.  The objective is to motivate
the observation of targets-of-opportunity, to drive robotic telescopes,
to trigger archive searches, and to alert the community.  VOEvent is
focused on the reporting of photon events, but events mediated by
disparate phenomena such as neutrinos, gravitational waves, and
solar or atmospheric particle bursts may also be reported.
</p>
<p>
Structured data is used, rather than natural language, so that
automated systems can effectively interpret VOEvent packets. Each
packet may contain one or more of the "who, what, where, when &amp; how"
of a detected event, but in addition, may contain a hypothesis (a "why")
regarding the nature of the underlying physical cause of the event.
Citations to previous VOEvents may be used to place each event in its
correct context. Proper curation is encouraged throughout each event's
life cycle from discovery through successive follow-ups.
</p>
<p>
VOEvent packets gain persistent identifiers and are typically stored
in databases reached via registries. VOEvent packets may therefore
reference other packets in various ways. Subscribers, human or
machine, receive immediate notification of events, based on previously
defined criteria. Packets are encouraged to be small and to be processed
quickly. This standard does not define a transport layer or the
design of clients, repositories, publishers or brokers; it does not
cover policy issues such as who can publish, who can build a registry
of events, who can subscribe to a particular registry, nor the
intellectual property issues.
</p>
<h2>1. <a id="intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
Throughout human history, unexpected events in the sky have been
interpreted as portents and revelations. Modern curiosity seeks to
use such transient events to probe the fundamental nature of the
universe. In decades to come the scientific study of such events
will be greatly extended, with new survey telescopes making wide-area
systematic searches for time-varying astronomical events, and with a
large number of robotic facilities standing ready to respond. These
events may reflect purely local solar system phenomena such as
comets, solar flares, asteroids and Kuiper Belt Objects, or those
more distant such as gravitational microlensing, supernovae and
Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). Most exciting of all may be new and unknown
types of event, heralding new horizons for astrophysics.  Searches
for astrophysical events are taking place at all electromagnetic
wavelengths from gamma-rays to radio, as well as quests for more
exotic events conveyed by such means as neutrinos, gravitational
waves or high-energy cosmic rays.
</p>
<p>
For many types of events, astrophysical knowledge is gained through
fast, comprehensive follow-up observation &#8212; perhaps the immediate
acquisition of the spectrum of a suspected optical counterpart, for
example &#8212; and in general, by observations made with instruments
in different wavelength regimes or at different times. To satisfy
these needs, several projects are commissioning robotic telescopes
to respond to digital alerts by pointing the telescope and triggering
observations in near real-time and without human intervention. These 
include, for instance, 
Skyalert[<a href="#skyalert">6</a>] in the USA, and
RoboNet-1.0 [<a href="#robonet">13</a>] and eStar[<a href="#estar">3</a>] in the United Kingdom.
Automated systems
may also query archives and initiate pipelines in response to such alerts.
</p>
<p>
Many projects have been conceived &#8212; some now in operation &#8212;
that will discover such time-critical celestial events. These include
a large number of robotic survey and monitoring telescopes with apertures
from tens of centimeters to tens of meters, large-field survey projects
like CRTS [<a href="#crts">9</a>], PTF [<a href="#ptf">##</a>], Pan-STARRS
[<a href="#panstarrs">10</a>] and LSST [<a href="#lsst">8</a>], satellites 
like Swift and Fermi [<a href="#swift">12</a>], and more singular experiments like
LIGO [<a href="#ligo">7</a>]. 
The community
has demonstrated that robotic telescopes [<a href="#robot">14</a>] can
quickly follow-up events using the standard outlined in this document.
In the past, human-centric event alert systems have been very successful,
including the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams (CBAT)
[<a href="#cbat">2</a>] and the Astronomer's Telegram (ATEL)
[<a href="#atel">1</a>], but these systems use predominantly
natural-language text to describe each event, and do 
not have sophisticated selection criteria for subscribers.
The GRB Coordinates Network (GCN)
[<a href="#gcn">4</a>] reports one of the most fruitful event streams
of current times, and its events are transmitted very successfully for
follow-up within seconds or minutes. With VOEvent, we would like to
leverage the success of GCN by making it interoperable with other
producers of events, and by generalizing its transport mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>
A much larger rate of events can be expected as new facilities are
commissioned or more fully automated. These rates indicate events
that must be handled by machines, not humans. Subscribing agents
must be able to automatically filter a tractable number of events
without missing any that may be key to achieving their goals. In
general, the number of pending events from a large-scale survey 
telescope (such as LSST) that are above the horizon at a given
observatory during a given observing session may be orders of
magnitude larger than a human can sift through productively.
Selection criteria will need to be quite precise to usefully
throttle the incoming event stream(s) &#8212; say &#8212; <i>"give 
me all events in which a point source R-band magnitude increase of
at least -2.0 was seen to occur in less than four hours, that are
located within specified molecular column density contours of a
prioritized list of galactic star forming regions"</i>. In practice
the result of complex queries such as these will be transmitted
through intermediary "brokers" &#8212; which will subscribe to
VOEvent-producing systems and provide filter services to client
groups ("subscribers") via specialized VOEvents. Filtering will often
be based on coincidence between multiple events.  A gravitational
wave detector may produce a large number of candidate events, but the
interesting ones may be only those that register with multiple instruments. 
</p>
<p>
Handling the anticipated event rates quickly and accurately will
require alert packets to be issued in a structured data format, not
natural language. Such a structured discovery alert &#8212; and any
follow-up packets &#8212; will be referred to as a VOEvent.  VOEvent
will rely on XML schemata [<a href="#xml">30</a>] to provide the
appropriate structured syntax and semantics. These schemata may be
specific to VOEvent or may reference external libraries such as the
IVOA's Space-Time Coordinate (STC) metadata specification
[<a href="#stc">18</a>], the Remote Telescope Markup Language (RTML)
[<a href="#rtml">15</a>], 
or the simpleTimeSeries specification from the dotAstro project [**]
</p>
<p> VOEvent is a pragmatic effort that crosses the boundary between
the Virtual Observatory and the larger astronomical community. The
results of astronomical observations using real telescopes must be
expressed using the IVOA VOEvent standard, be recorded and transmitted
via registries and aggregators within and outside the VO, and then be
captured and filtered by subscribing VO clients.  Each event that
survives rigorous filtering can then be passed to other real (or
possibly virtual) telescopes, for instance via RTML, to acquire real
follow-up observations that will confirm (or deny) the original hypothesis
as to the classification of the object(s) or processes that generated
that particular VOEvent in the first place. This must happen quickly
(often within seconds of the original VOEvent) and must minimize
unnecessary expenditures of either real or virtual resources.
</p>
<p>
VOEvent is a mechanism for broadcasting discoveries that others may
wish to follow-up, and this purpose defines its scope. An astronomical
discovery that cannot benefit from immediate follow-up is not a good
candidate for expression as a VOEvent.
</p>
<p>
Following the <a href="#abstract">Abstract</a> and
<a href="#intro">Introduction</a>, this document contains a discussion
of appropriate VOEvent usage in <a href="#usage">§2</a>.  Section
<a href="#semantics">3</a> is the heart of the document, conveying the 
semantics of a VOEvent packet. Explicit examples of VOEvent packets are
in <a href="#examples">§4</a>, and linked references in
<a href="#refer">§5</a>.
</p>
<h3>1.1 Changes from VOEvent 1.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>The concept of event stream in introduced in section 2.2, this in new in VOEvent 2.0.
The stream metadata acts as a template for the events in the stream, and is registered with the VO registry.

<li>The section on transport of VOEvents has been removed, so it can be handled in its own 
standards process.

<li>The section on Registry enhancements to support VOEvent has been expanded and clarified.

<li> The &lt;Param&gt; elements can now have &lt;Description&gt; and &lt;Reference&gt; elements
<li> The value of a &lt;Param&gt; element can now be expressed as an element in 
addition to an attribute.
<li> The &lt;Param&gt; element now has an attribute "dataType" to express the meaning of the parameter value (int, float, string).
<li> There is a new &lt;Table&gt; element to express simple tables, see section 3.3.3.
<li> There is a new &lt;SimpleTimeSeries&gt; element to express time series, 
with particular application for light curves. See section 3.3.4.
<li> The VOEvent packet structure still conforms to the IVOA <i>Space-Time Coordinates </i>
standard, but there is a new, simplified schema for these elements that is completely within
the VOEvent schema.
<li> The semantic implication of a &lt;Citation&gt; element is clarified: section 3.7
<li> The &lt;Reference&gt; element has a more sophisticated notion of <i>type</i>
as a general URI rather than enumeration of a few.
</ul>

<h2>2. <a id="usage" name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>
This document defines the semantics of an alert packet known as
VOEvent [<a href="#voevent">21</a>]. In this document, the word
<i>packet</i> will refer to a
single, syntactically complete, VOEvent alert or message, however
transmitted or stored. The transmission of such a packet announces
that an astronomical "event" has occurred, or provides information
contingent on a previous VOEvent through a citation mechanism. The 
packet may include information regarding the "who, what, where, when &amp; how" 
of the event, and may express one or more "why" hypotheses regarding
the physical cause of the observed event and the likelihood of each
of these hypotheses. 
</p>
<h3>2.1 Publishing VOEvent Packets</h3>
<p>
VOEvent packets express sky transient alerts.  VOEvent users subscribe
to the types of alerts pertinent to their science goals.  In addition to Publisher
and Subscriber, the following roles define the interchange of VOEvent semantics:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
An <i><b>Author</b></i> is anyone (or any organization) creating scientific
content suitable for representation as a sky transient alert.  An author
will typically register with the IVOA registry, so that the <b>&lt;Who&gt;</b>
element of VOEvent packets can be small and reusable, expressing only the
IVOA identifier needed to retrieve the contact information for the author.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
A <i><b>Publisher</b></i> receives alerts from one-or-more authors, and
assigns a unique identifier to each resulting packet.  Either the author or
the publisher generates the actual XML syntax of the event, but the publisher
is responsible for the validity of the packet relative to the VOEvent schema.
Publishers will register with the IVOA registry as described below.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
A <i><b>Repository</b></i> subscribes to one or more VOEvent streams, persists
packets either permanently or temporarily, and runs a service that allows clients
to resolve identifiers and apply complex queries to its holdings.  A given packet
had one Publisher but may be held in more than one Repository.  Public repositories
will register with the IVOA registry.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
A <i><b>Subscriber</b></i> is any entity that receives VOEvent packets for
whatever purpose.  Subscribers can find out how to get certain types of events
by consulting the lists of publishers and repositories in the IVOA registry.
A subscription is a filter on the stream of events from a publisher: the
subscriber is notified whenever certain criteria are met.  For example, the
filter may involve the curation part of the event (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>"all events
published by the Swift spacecraft"</i>), its location (<i>"anything in M31"</i>),
or it may reference the detailed metadata of the event itself (<i>"whenever the
cosmic ray energy is greater than 3 TeV"</i>).
<p></p>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
A <i><b>Broker</b></i> or <b><i>Relay</i></b>, also sometimes known as
a <i>Filter</i>, is any combination of the atomic roles of Publisher,
Repository, or Subscriber that also offers arbitrary application-level
functionality.  See the IVOA VOEvent Transport Note [<a href="#voevent">21</a>]
for further discussion.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.2 VO Identifiers (IVORNs) and Publishers</h3>
<p>
VOEvent benefits from the IVOA identifiers developed for the VO registry.
Such an identifier is called an <i>IVORN</i>, that is, an <i>International Virtual
Observatory Resource Name</i>.  It is required to begin with <b><i>"ivo://"</i></b>,
and will stand in for a particular packet. A <i>registered</i> VOEvent packet is
one that has a valid identifier &#8212; meaning that a registry exists that can
resolve that identifier to the full VOEvent packet.
VOEvent identifiers thus provide a citation mechanism &#8212; a way to express
that one VOEvent packet is a <i>follow-up</i> in some fashion of a previous
packet.  For these reasons, VOEvent packets will often contain VO identifiers
[<a href="#id">16</a>].  These take the general form
<b><i>ivo://authorityID/resourceKey#local_ID</i></b>, and are references
to metadata packets that may be found at a VO registry or VOEvent repository.
There are several types of metadata schema that the registry
can hold.  For the purposes of VOEvent, the principal schemata are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>VOEvent</b>: the metadata packet for an alert resulting from the observation
of a transient celestial event.  This schema is defined in this document.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
<b>VOEventStream</b>: the metadata packet for a stream 
of VOEvents, including information about who is running it, 
the parameters that may be included and their meaning.
The VOEventStream may also be shortened to just 'stream', they mean the same thing.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
<b>VOEventServer</b>: the metadata packet to describe a
service that provides VOEvents, which may be past events from a repository query service,
or may be events sent in near real-time from a subscription service.
The server definition includes the list of streams whose events
are kept, the service endpoint to query the repository, or the endpoint to
resolve a VOEvent identifier.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
<b>Author Organization</b>: this metadata describes an author, including
contact information and a description of the project.  The VOEvent
<b>&lt;Who&gt;</b> element contains either a reference to an author's
IVORN or explicit contact information sufficient to describe the author.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When such an identifier is <i>resolved</i>, it means that the VOEvent
metadata packet is obtained in exchange for the identifier. Such resolution
happens through the global, distributed IVOA registry in stages.  The registry
is queried to locate a repository holding the relevant packet, and then the
repository is queried for the packet itself.
The part of the IVORN before the "#" symbol points to the <i>VOEventStream</i> of which the
event is a member; the whole IVORN (that includes the local_ID) points to the event itself.
Thus VOEvent identifiers are overloaded; they contain a stream
identifier, then the "#" sign, then the local reference within that stream.
</p>
<p>
This is a key point in understanding VOEvent identifiers: 
<b>The Event identifier also expresses the Stream identifier.</b>
For example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>ivo://nvo.caltech/voeventnet/catot#1004071150784109051</em><br>
<p>
This identifier points to a specific VOEvent (number <em>1004071150784109051</em>) that is an 
instance of the stream called <em>ivo://nvo.caltech/voeventnet/catot</em>.
However, this IVORN will not resolve from the global
VO registry, but only from a repository that has this stream of events.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<em>ivo://nvo.caltech/voeventnet/catot</em><br>
<p>
This Stream identifier can be looked up in any VO registry, returning a description, who runs it, 
the names, semantics, and descriptions of the parameters used in the events, 
how to subscribe, etc.  In this case, the stream represents optical transients 
from the CRTS survey. For resolving the event itself, we want a repository 
that will have the event, so a query would be used like this: 
<em>"Find repositories that keep the events from this Stream"</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<p>
The nature of a standard service to query VOEvent server records and
the metadata necessary to describe a Stream remain under debate in the VOEvent Working Group.
</p>
<h3>2.3 Authentication and Authorization</h3>
<p>
VOEvents provide a mechanism for alerting members of the astronomical
community to time-critical celestial phenomena. As a result of such
an alert, significant hardware, software and personnel assets of the
community may be retargeted to investigate those phenomena. The
scientific and financial costs of such retargeting may be large, but
the potential scientific gains are larger. The success of VOEvent &#8212;
and of observations of astronomical transients in general &#8212; depends
on minimizing both intentional and unintentional noise/spam associated 
with this communications channel. All of the familiar internet security
worries apply to VOEvents. These questions are addressed elsewhere.
</p>
<h3>2.4 Vocabulary usage in VOEvent</h3>

<font color="red">
Describe how vocabularies fit into various niches in VOEvent elements.
</font>

<h3>2.5 Registry Enhancements</h3>
<p>
The registry enhancements (proposed elsewhere) will make it easier to work with VOEvents. 
These consist of metadata records called VOEventStream and VOEventServer, as described below.
<ul>
</p>
<h4>2.5.1 VOEventStreams in the VO Registry</h4>
The stream metadata defines the meanings of the parameters and table columns that are used in a homogeneous
collection of events from a specific project, instrument, or observatory. 
The VO Registry will hold these definitions, and will have the following purposes and capabilities.
<ul>
<li>Resolving an event: the unique identifier for an event is a concatenation of a stream identifier 
and an event number within that stream. A question to the Registry finds which VOEventServer 
has query capability for that stream, and then that server can be probed to get the full event metadata.</li>

<li>What is this event: the event identifier contains the VOEventStream identifier, 
from which the Registry can produce the descriptive text, contact information for the responsible people, 
and so on.</li>

<li>Subscription to a stream: VOEventServers are being built to push events to those who want them 
by a variety of messaging protocols; in order for an astronomer to set this up, the Registry is 
asked which servers provide the "subscription capability" for the given stream, so that the 
astronomer can work with that server to set up future delivery of events.</li>

<li>Creating a Stream: A survey or project may wish to publish am event stream. The Registry will 
provide a way to define the nature of the coming events (VOEventStream) and where to get 
them (VOEventServer), and thus allow others to find and subscribe to those events. </li>

<li>What does this Parameter mean: Each event has a set of keyword parameters; the Registry can be 
used to find out their meanings.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2.5.2 VOEventServer in the VO Registry</h4>
<p>
Once the stream is defined in the registry, the question is how to find it, with the kinds of 
services that might be wanted. These are known as Capabilities in the VO registry model. Three kinds of 
capability that we can mention are subscription, formal query, and informal query. If a server supports a 
subscription capability, it means that a client can submit a criterion 
(for example "R magnitude brighter than 17"), and events will be sent by the server in the future which 
satisfy that criterion. A formal query capability implies the existence of a formal request-response 
protocol by which queries can be made and results returned; this will be the "Simple Event Access Protocol" 
when it becomes an IVOA recommendation. An informal query capability means a web page with forms by 
which a collection of events can be browsed in some way. 
</p><p>
The capability of a server is split further into Interfaces, which express precisely how the 
capability can be accessed by a client. For example, subscription capability could be achieved by 
having email, instant messaging, or text message sent; these are three different interfaces to the 
subscription capability, and there is different metadata associated with each (email address vs 
phone number for example).
</p>
</ul>

<h2>3. <a id="semantics" name="semantics">VOEvent Semantics</a></h2>
<p>
A VOEvent packet provides a general purpose mechanism for representing information about
transient astronomical events. However, not all VO data are suitable
for expression using VOEvent. The VOEvent schema [<a href="#schema">6</a>]
is as simple as practical to allow the minimal representation of
scientifically meaningful, time critical, events. VOEvent also borrows
other standard VO and astronomical schema, specifically STC for
space-time coordinates and simpleTimeSeries to represent light curves and 
other time series.
The usual IVOA standards such as registries and UCD identifiers are
used. VOEvent has a strong interest in the development of complete and
robust astronomical ontologies, but must rely on pragmatic and immediately
useful prototypes of planned facilities.
</p>
<p>
By definition, a VOEvent packet contains a single XML <b>&lt;VOEvent&gt;</b> 
element. Multiple <b>&lt;VOEvent&gt;</b> elements may be jointly contained
within a larger XML document, but these should be handled as separate
alert packets.  A <b>&lt;VOEvent&gt;</b> element may contain at most one
of each of the following optional sub-elements: 
</p><ol>
  <ol>
    <table>
      <tbody>

<p>
Only those elements required to convey the event being described need
be present; the ordering of elements is immaterial to interpretation,
but may be important for efficient processing in demanding applications.
The intent of VOEvent is to describe a single astronomical transient
event per packet. Multiple events should be expressed using multiple
packets. On the other hand, complex observations may best be expressed
using multiple follow-up packets or via embedded <b>&lt;References&gt;</b> 
to external resources such as VOTables or RTML documents. XML structures
other than those listed in this document should be used with care within
a <b>&lt;VOEvent&gt;</b> element, but some applications may require
the freedom to reference schema outside the scope of this specification.
Section 4 contains examples of complete VOEvent packets.
</p>
<h3>3.1 <a id="voevent" name="voevent"><b>&lt;VOEvent&gt;</b></a> &#8212;
identifiers, roles and versions</h3>
<p>
A <b>&lt;VOEvent&gt;</b> expresses the discovery of a sky transient event, 
located in a region of space and time, observed by an instrument, and
published by a person or institution who may have developed a hypothesis
about the underlying classification of the event.
</p>
<p>
The <b>&lt;VOEvent&gt;</b> element has three attributes:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
<b>3.1.1 <i>ivorn</i></b> &#8212; Each VOEvent packet is required to have 
one-and-only-one identifier, expressed with the <b><i>ivorn</i></b>
attribute.  VOEvent identifiers are URIs [<a href="#id">16</a>]. As the
issuance of duplicate identifiers would diminish the trust placed in
systems exchanging VOEvents, it is anticipated that a number of VOEvent
publishers will be founded to issue unique IVORNs from a variety of
useful and appropriate namespaces. The identifier actually contains
TWO IDENTIFIERS: the first part is the identifier for the publisher,
and the event identifier is built from this, then a # symbol, then a
local string that is meaningful only in the context of that publisher.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.1.2 <i>role</i></b> &#8212; The optional <b><i>role</i></b> attribute 
accepts several possible values, including these:</p>
<li>
The value <i>"observation"</i> is the default if the <i><b>role</b></i> 
is missing; this means that the packet describes an observation of the
actual universe.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
The value <i>"prediction"</i> indicates that the VOEvent describes an
event of whatever description that has yet to occur when the packet
is created. 
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
The value <i>"utility"</i> means that the packet expresses nothing
about astrophysics, but rather information about the observing system.
This could be used, for example, for a satellite to express that it
has changed its configuration.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
A <i>"test"</i> means that the packet does not describe actual
astronomical events, but rather is part of a testing procedure
of some kind.
</li>
<p>
<b>It is the responsibility of all who receive VOEvent packets to pay
attention to the <b><i>role</i></b>, and to be quite sure of the
difference between an actual event and a test of the system or a
prediction of an event that has yet to happen.</b>
</p>
<p>
<b>3.1.3 <i>version</i></b> &#8212; The <b><i>version</i></b> attribute
is required to be present and to equal "2.0" for all VOEvent packets
governed by this version of the standard. There is no default value.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
For example, a <b>&lt;VOEvent&gt;</b> packet resulting from Tycho
Brahe's discovery of a "Stella Nova" in Cassiopeia on 11 November 1572
[<a href="#tycho">25</a>] might start:
</p>
<pre>  &lt;VOEvent ivorn="ivo://uraniborg.hven#1572-11-11/0001" 
        role="observation" version="2.0" xmlns:... &gt;
</pre>
<p>
The <b><i>xmlns</i></b> attribute refers to one-or-more standard XML
namespace declarations that may optionally help define the contents
of a packet.
</p>
<h3>3.2 <a id="who" name="who"><b>&lt;Who&gt;</b></a> &#8212;
Curation Metadata</h3>
<p>
This element of a VOEvent packet is devoted to curation metadata:
who is responsible for the information content of the packet. Usage
should be compatible with section 3.2 of the IVOA Resource Metadata
specification [<a href="#rm">17</a>].
</p>
<p>
Typical curation content would include:
</p>
<ul>
<h4>3.2.1&lt;Author&gt;</h4>
<p>
Author information follows the IVOA curation information schema:
the organization responsible for the packet can have a title, short
name or acronym, and a logo. A contact person has a name, email, and
phone number. Other contributors can also be noted.
</p>
<p>
An example of Author information might be:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Author&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Rapid Telescope for Optical Response&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;shortName&gt;Raptor&lt;/shortName&gt;
    &lt;logoURL&gt;http://www.raptor.lanl.gov/images/RAPTOR_patchLarge.jpg&lt;/logoURL&gt;
    &lt;contactName&gt;Robert White&lt;/contactName&gt;
    &lt;contactEmail&gt;rwhite@lanl.gov&lt;/contactEmail&gt;
    &lt;contactPhone&gt;+1 800 555 1212&lt;/contactPhone&gt;
&lt;/Author&gt;
</pre>
<h4>3.2.2&lt;AuthorIVORN&gt;</h4>
<p>
As an alternative to quoting Author information over and over, this
information can be published to the VO registry, then referenced
through an IVORN. The <b>&lt;AuthorIVORN&gt;</b> element contains
the identifier of the organization responsible for making the VOEvent
available. Event subscribers will often use this as their primary
filtering criterion. Many subscribers will only want events from a
particular publisher, or more precisely, from a specific content
creator. In general, <b>&lt;AuthorIVORN&gt;</b> should be a VOResource
identifier that resolves to an organization in the sense of
[<a href="#rm">17</a>].  Publishers and subscribers may use this
VOResource to exchange curation metadata directly.
</p>
<h4>3.2.3 &lt;Date&gt;</h4>
<p>
The <b>&lt;Date&gt;</b> contains the date and time of the creation
of the VOEvent packet. The required format is ISO-8601 (<i>e.g.</i>,
<i>yyyy-mm-dd<b>T</b>hh:mm:ss.s</i>, see [<a href="#iso8601">29</a>]).
The timescale &#8212; for curation purposes only &#8212; is assumed
to be Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Discussion of date and time
for the expression of meaningful scientific coordinates may be found
in [<a href="#stc">18</a>] and [<a href="#utc">27</a>].
</p>
</ul>
<p>
Minimal <b>&lt;Who&gt;</b> usage might resemble:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Who&gt;
    &lt;AuthorIVORN&gt;ivo://uraniborg.hven/Tycho&lt;/AuthorIVORN&gt;
    &lt;Date&gt;1573-05-05T01:23:45Z&lt;/Date&gt;
&lt;/Who&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Tycho first noted SN 1572 on 11 November of that year. The event was
published in Tycho's pamphlet <i>De Stella Nova</i> by 5 May 1573,
thus this later date is placed in the curation metadata. More detailed
curation metadata can be retrieved directly from the publisher.
</p>
<h3>3.3 <a id="what" name="what"><b>&lt;What&gt;</b></a> &#8212;
Event Characterization</h3>
<p>
The <b>&lt;What&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Why&gt;</b> elements work together
to characterize the nature of a VOEvent. That is: <b>&lt;What&gt;</b>
has author-defined parameters about what was measured directly,  or other relevant information about the event, 
versus <b>&lt;Why&gt;</b> is a data model of fixed schema about the 
hypothesized underlying cause or causes of the astrophysical event.
</p>
<p>
In general, an observation is the association of one or more dependent
variables with zero or more independent variables. The
<b>&lt;WhereWhen&gt;</b> element, for example, is often used to
express the independent variables in an observation &#8212; where was
the telescope pointed and when was the camera shutter opened. 
The <b>&lt;What&gt;</b> element, on the other hand, is typically used
to express the dependent variables &#8212; what was seen at that
location at that time.
</p>
<p>
A <b>&lt;What&gt;</b> element contains a list of <b>&lt;Param&gt;</b>
elements which may be associated and labeled using <b>&lt;Group&gt;</b>
elements. 
It may also contain <b>&lt;Table&gt;</b> elements, 
and <b>&lt;simpleTimeSeries&gt;</b> elements.
See <a href="#examples">§4.1</a> for an example of usage.
</p>
<h4>3.3.1 &lt;Param&gt; &#8212; Numbers and strings with semantics</h4>
<p>
<b>&lt;Param&gt;</b> elements may be used to represent the values
of arbitrarily named quantities. Thus a publisher need not establish
a fixed schema for all events they issue. Unified Content Descriptors
(UCDs) [<a href="#ucd">19</a>] may be used to clarify meaning. Usage
of <b>&lt;Param&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Group&gt;</b> is similar to the
VOTable specification, see §4.1 of [<a href="#votable">22</a>].
</p><p>
A <b>&lt;Param&gt;</b> may contain elements <b>&lt;Description&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b>. Like
most VOEvent elements, these can be used 
to give further descriptive documentation about what this parameter means. 
The <b>&lt;Param&gt;</b> may also contain an element <b>&lt;Value&gt;</b> 
for the value of the parameter, as an alternate to the 'value' attribute defined below: if both
are present, the attribute takes precedence ofv the element.
This allows parameter values to include a richer variety of text strings, to avoid strings being
changed by Attribute-Value normalization [<a href="#avn">**</a>]
that is part of the XML specification.
</p><p>
The following attributes are supported for <b>&lt;Param&gt;</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
3.3.1.1 <i><b>name</b></i> &#8212; A simple utilitarian name that may be 
used elsewhere in the packet. This name may or may not have significance 
to subscribing clients.
</p>
<p>
3.3.1.2 <i><b>value</b></i> &#8212; A string representing the value in 
question. No range or type checking of implied numbers is performed.
</p>
<p>
3.3.1.3 <i><b>unit</b></i> &#8212; The unit for interpreting
<b><i>value</i></b>.  See §4.3 of [<a href="#votable">22</a>]
which relies on [<a href="#units">26</a>]. 
</p>
<p>
3.3.1.4 <i><b>ucd</b></i> &#8212; A UCD [<a href="#ucd">19</a>]
expression characterizing the nature of the <b>&lt;Param&gt;</b>.
</p>
<p>
3.3.1.5 <i><b>dataType</b></i> &#8212; A string specifying
the data type of the <b>&lt;Param&gt;</b>.  Allowed values are "string", "int", or "float", 
with the default being "string".
</p>
</ul>
<p>
For example, here are three values from a GCN [<a href="#gcn">4</a>] notice: 
</p>
<pre>TRIGGER_NUM = 114299
RATE_SIGNIF = 20.49
GRB_INTEN = 73288
</pre>
<p>
In VOEvent, these can be represented as:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Param name="TRIGGER_NUM" value="114299" ucd="meta.id" /&gt;
&lt;Param name="RATE_SIGNIF" value="20.49"  ucd="stat.snr" &gt;
    &lt;Description&gt;Best significance after trying all algorithms&lt;/Description&gt;
    &lt;Reference uri="http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/swift.html"/&gt; 
&lt;/Param&gt;
&lt;Param name="GRB_INTEN  " value="73288"  ucd="phot.count" /&gt;
</pre>
<h4>3.3.2 &lt;Group&gt; &#8212; collection of related Params</h4>
<p>
<b>&lt;Group&gt;</b> provides a simple mechanism for associating several 
<b>&lt;Param&gt;</b> (and/or <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b>) elements, for
instance, an error with a measurement. <b>&lt;Groups&gt;</b> may NOT
be nested. <b>&lt;Group&gt;</b> elements may have a <i><b>name</b></i>
attribute, and unlike VOTable usage, may also have a <i><b>type</b></i>
attribute:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
3.3.2.1 <i><b>name</b></i> &#8212; A simple name such as in
<a href="#what">§3.3.1.1</a>. 
</p>
<p>
3.3.2.2 <i><b>type</b></i> &#8212; A string that can be used to specify 
the "datatype" of simple application dependent data structures.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
In a GCN notice, for example, we might see this line:
</p>
<pre>GRB_INTEN:       73288 [cnts]    Peak=1310 [cnts/sec]
</pre>
<p> which could be expressed with one Param with a Value element, and the other with a Value attribute: </p>
<pre>&lt;Group type="GRB_INTEN"&gt;
    &lt;Param name="cnts" ucd="phot.count" &gt; 
        &lt;Value&gt;73288&lt;/Value&gt; &lt;/Param&gt;
    &lt;Param name="peak" value="1310"  ucd="arith.rate;phot.count" /&gt;
&lt;/Group&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Note that the UCDs above carry the semantics of photon counts and counts 
per second.
</p>
<h4>3.3.3 <b>&lt;Table&gt;</b> &#8212; simple tabular data</h4>
<p>
This element is intended for a short and simple table.
It should be noted that longer tables, or any table, can be linked using a <b>&lt;Reference&gt; </b>
element. There are five elements defined in this subsection: Table, Field, Data, TR, TD.
</p>
A <b>&lt;Table&gt;</b> element can contain a sequence of <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b> elements, 
one for each column of the table,
then a single <b>&lt;Data&gt;</b> element that contains the data of the table, which is represented as a sequence
of table rows, which are <b>&lt;TR&gt;</b> elements, each containing a sequence of <b>&lt;TD&gt;</b> elements for the table cells.
For a full table, where every cell has a value, the number of <b>&lt;TD&gt;</b> elements in each row should be the 
same as the number of <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b> elements. There is then a 1-to-1 correspondence between them for each row.
</p><p>
The Table can contain <b>&lt;Description&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b> elements 
to add documentation; the <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b> elements can also contain these.
Thus the <b>&lt;Table&gt;</b> can contain, in order, an optional <b>&lt;Description&gt;</b> and 
<b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b>, then a sequence 
of one or more <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b> elements, then a <b>&lt;Data&gt;</b> element. 
The <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b> element can also contain 
optional <b>&lt;Description&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b> and nothing else. 
The <b>&lt;Data&gt;</b> element can contain only 
<b>&lt;TR&gt;</b> elements, each of which can contain only <b>&lt;TD&gt;</b> elements. 
The following explains the attributes that are allowed for these five elements.
</p>
<p>
The following attributes are supported for <b>&lt;Table&gt;</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
3.3.3.1 <i><b>name</b></i> &#8212; A simple utilitarian name that may be 
used for identification or presentation purposes. This name may or may not have significance 
to subscribing clients.
</p>
<p>
3.3.3.2 <i><b>type</b></i> &#8212; A string representing the type of the Table, that consumers
can use for presentation or parsing. For example, a table of type "spectralLines" could mean to
some community to expect columns (i.e. the <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b>s) named "wavelength", "width", "name" to define 
spectral lines.
</p>
</ul>
The <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b> element defines the semantic nature of a Table column, and is structured similarly to
the <b>&lt;Param&gt;</b> element of section 3.3.1. 
The following attributes are supported for <b>&lt;Field&gt;</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
3.3.3.3 <i><b>name</b></i> &#8212; A simple utilitarian name that may be 
used elsewhere in the packet. This name may or may not have significance 
to subscribing clients.
</p>
<p>
<p>
3.3.3.4 <i><b>unit</b></i> &#8212; The unit for interpreting
the values as given in the <b>&lt;TD&gt;</b> table cells  See §4.3 of [<a href="#votable">22</a>]
which relies on [<a href="#units">26</a>]. 
</p>
<p>
3.3.3.5 <i><b>ucd</b></i> &#8212; A UCD [<a href="#ucd">19</a>]
expression characterizing the nature of the data in this table column.
</p>
<p>
3.3.1.6 <i><b>dataType</b></i> &#8212; A string specifying
the data type of the table column.  Allowed values are "string", "int", or "float", 
with the default being "string".
</p>
</ul>
The following is an example of a Table element. Note the <b>dataType</b> attribute that is used
to interpret the values in the table cells.
<pre>
 &lt;Table&gt;
      &lt;Description&gt;Individually Referenced Moduli and Distances for NGC 0931 from NED&lt;/Description&gt;
      &lt;Field name="(m-M)"    unit="mag" ucd="phot.mag.distMod"/&gt;
      &lt;Field name="err(m-M)" unit="mag" ucd="phot.mag.distMod;stat.err"/&gt;
      &lt;Field name="D"        unit="Mpc" ucd="pos.distance"/&gt;
      &lt;Field name="REFCODE"             ucd="meta.bib.bibcode"/&gt;
      &lt;Data&gt;  	
        &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;33.16&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.38&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;42.9&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;1997ApJS..109..333W&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
        &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;33.32&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.38&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;46.1&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;1997ApJS..109..333W&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
        &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;33.51&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.48&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;50.4&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2009ApJS..182..474S&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;	
        &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;33.55&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.38&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;51.3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;1997ApJS..109..333W&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
        &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;33.71&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.43&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;55.2&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;2009ApJS..182..474S&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
        &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;34.01&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;0.80&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;63.3&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;1997ApJS..109..333W&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
      &lt;/Data&gt;
    &lt;/Table&gt;
</pre>

<h4>3.3.4 &lt;SimpleTimeSeries&gt; for Time Series data</h4>
<font color=red>Need some input here from Brewer and Bloom.</font>



<h3>3.4 <a id="wherewhen" name="wherewhen"><b>&lt;WhereWhen&gt;</b></a> &#8212; 
  Space-Time Coordinates</h3>
<font color="red">
Is the WhereWhen time the time of the event, or is it thr reference time for the light curves?
</font>
<p>
A VOEvent packet will typically include information about where in the sky
and when in time an event was detected, and from what location, along with spatial
and temporal coordinate systems and errors.  If either the spatial or temporal
locators are absent, it is to be assumed that the information is either unknown
or irrelevant.  VOEvent v2.0 uses the syntax of the IVOA Space-Time Coordinate (STC)
specification version 1.30 or later; the <b>&lt;WhereWhen&gt;</b> element may
reference an STC [<a href="#stc">18</a>]
<b>&lt;ObsDataLocation&gt;</b> element to provide a sky location and time for the event.  
VOEvent publishers should
construct expressions that concisely provide all information that is
scientifically significant to the event, and no more than that.
See <a href="#examples">§4.1</a> for an example of usage.
</p>
<p>
STC expressions are used to locate the physical phenomena associated with a
VOEvent alert in both time and space as described below. The
<b>&lt;ObsDataLocation&gt;</b> element is a combination of information
describing the location of an observation in the sky along with information
describing the location of the observatory from which that observation was made.
Both the sky and the observatory are in constant motion, and STC inextricably
relates spatial and temporal information.
</p>
<p>
<pre>&lt;WhereWhen&gt;
    &lt;ObsDataLocation&gt;
        &lt;ObservatoryLocation/&gt;
        &lt;ObservationLocation/&gt;
    &lt;/ObsDataLocation&gt;
&lt;/WhereWhen&gt;</pre>
<h4>3.4.1 ObservationLocation</h4>
<p>
The <b>&lt;ObservationLocation&gt;</b> should contain a link to a coordinate
system, <b>&lt;AstroCoordSystem&gt;</b>, as well as the actual coordinates,
<b>&lt;AstroCoords&gt;</b>, containing a reference back to the coordinate system
specification.  For example: 
</p>
<pre>&lt;ObservationLocation&gt;

    &lt;AstroCoordSystem id="<font color="#9a0301"><i>UTC-FK5-GEO</i></font>" /&gt;

    &lt;AstroCoords coord_system_id="<font color="#9a0301"><i>UTC-FK5-GEO</i></font>"&gt;
        &lt;Time unit="s"&gt;
            &lt;TimeInstant&gt;
                &lt;ISOTime&gt;2004-07-15T08:23:56&lt;/ISOTime&gt;
            &lt;/TimeInstant&gt;
            &lt;Error&gt;2&lt;/Error&gt;
        &lt;/Time&gt;
        &lt;Position2D unit="deg"&gt;
            &lt;Value2&gt;
                &lt;C1&gt;148.88821&lt;/C1&gt;
                &lt;C2&gt;69.06529&lt;/C2&gt;
            &lt;/Value2&gt;
            &lt;Error2Radius&gt;0.03&lt;/Error2Radius&gt;
        &lt;/Position2D&gt;
    &lt;/AstroCoords&gt;
&lt;/ObservationLocation&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Specifying errors is optional but recommended for both time and space components.
</p>
<p>
The <b>&lt;AstroCoords&gt;</b> element has a <b><i>coord_system_id</i></b>
attribute and the <b>&lt;AstroCoordSystem&gt;</b> has a <b><i>id</i></b> attribute.
The value of both of these should be identical, and represent the space-time 
coordinate system that will be used for the event position and time.
</p>
<p>
A <b><i>coord_system_id</i></b> and <b><i>id</i></b> are built from a time part, a space part,
and a "center" specification, concatenated in that order and separated by hyphens.
Astronomical coordinate systems are extremely varied, but all
VOEvent subscribers should be prepared to handle coordinates expressed as
combinations of these basic defaults:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The time part can be <i>UTC</i> (Coordinated Universal Time [<a href="#stc">27</a>]),
<i>TT</i> (Terrestrial Time, currently 65.184 seconds ahead of UTC), or <i>TDB</i>
(Barycentric Dynamical Time).
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
The space part can be equatorial coordinates (right ascension and declination)
expressed in either the <i>ICRS</i> or <i>FK5</i> coordinate systems.
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
The center specification can be <i>TOPO</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the location of the
observatory), <i>GEO</i> (geocentric coordinates), or <i>BARY</i> (relative
to the barycenter of the solar system).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
It is assumed that the center reference position (origin) is the same for
both space and time coordinates. That means, for instance, that <i>BARY</i>
should only be paired with <i>TDB</i> (and vice-versa).  See the STC
specification [<a href="#stc">18</a>] for further discussion.  The list of
<b>&lt;AstroCoordSystem&gt;</b> defaults that VOEvent brokers and clients
may be called upon to understand is:
</p>
<i>
<ul>
<p>
</p><li>TT-ICRS-TOPO</li>
<li>UTC-ICRS-TOPO</li>
<li>TT-FK5-TOPO</li>
<li>UTC-FK5-TOPO</li>
<p></p><p>
</p><li>TT-ICRS-GEO</li>
<li>UTC-ICRS-GEO</li>
<li>TT-FK5-GEO</li>
<li>UTC-FK5-GEO</li>
<p></p><p>
</p><li>TDB-ICRS-BARY</li>
<li>TDB-FK5-BARY</li>
<p></p>
</ul>
</i>
<p>
The STC specification, in particular <b>&lt;ObsDataLocation&gt;</b> and its
contained elements, allows more exotic coordinate systems (for example, describing
planetary surfaces).  Further description of how VOEvent packets might be
constructed to convey such information to subscribers is outside the scope of
this document.  As with other elements of an alert packet, subscribers must be
prepared to understand coordinates expressing the science and experimental
design pertinent to the particular classes of sky transients that are of interest.
</p><p>
</p>
In short, subscribers are responsible for choosing what VOEvent packets and
thus <b><i>coord_system_id</i></b> values they will accept.  Further, subscribers
may choose not to distinguish between coordinate systems that are only subtly
different for their purposes &#8212; for instance between <i>ICRS</i> or <i>FK5</i>,
or between <i>TOPO</i> or <i>GEO</i>.  As software determines whether a packet's
<b><i>coord_system_id</i></b> describes a supported coordinate system, the question
is also what accuracy is required and what coordinate transformations may be
implicitly or explicitly performed to that level of accuracy.
<p></p>
<p>
A similar question faces the authors of VOEvent packets, who must make a
judicious choice between the available coordinate system options to meet the
expected scientific needs of consumers of those packets.  If a detailed or high
accuracy coordinate system selection is not needed, <b><i>UTC-ICRS-TOPO</i></b>
would be a good choice as an interoperability standard.
</p>
<h4>3.4.2 ObservatoryLocation</h4>
<p>
The <b>&lt;ObservatoryLocation&gt;</b> element is used to express the
location from which the observation being described was made.  It is a required
element for expressing topocentric coordinate systems.  An instance of
<b>&lt;ObservatoryLocation&gt;</b> may take two forms.  In the first, an
observatory location may be taken from a library, for example: 
</p>
<pre>&lt;ObservatoryLocation id="<font color="#9a0301"><i>Palomar</i></font>" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
The name of the id attribute is in <font color="#9a0301"><i>red italics</i></font>,
indicating a specific registered observatory, other examples being: Keck, KPNO,
JCMT, MMTO, VLA, <i>etc.</i> , or it may indicate one of the following generic
observatory locations:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>GEOSURFACE</i> - any location on the surface of the earth</li>
  <li><i>GEOLEO</i> - any location in Low Earth Orbit (altitude&lt;700 km)</li>
  <li><i>GEOGSO</i> - any location within Geostationary orbit altitude</li>
  <li><i>GEONBH</i> - any location within 50,000 km of the geocenter</li>
  <li><i>GEOLUN</i> - any location within the Moon's orbit</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, a packet might contain the following <b>&lt;ObservatoryLocation&gt;</b>
to indicate that the coordinates expressed in the <b>&lt;WhereWhen&gt;</b> element
are located with an accuracy comprising the Earth's surface:
</p>
<pre>&lt;ObservatoryLocation id="<font color="#9a0301"><i>GEOSURFACE</i></font>" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>
VOEvent Brokers are designed to comprise a high reliability, low latency, network.
These qualities can be used, as with mirroring the STC schema, to provide robust
access for VOEvent Subscribers by serving the library of observatory information.
</p>
<p>
The second option for <b>&lt;ObservatoryLocation&gt;</b> is that an observatory
can be located by specifying the actual coordinate values of longitude, latitude
and altitude on the surface of the Earth. Note the use of a coordinate system 
for the surface of the Earth (UTC-GEOD-TOPO) is natural for an observatory location, 
whereas coordinate systems in the previous section are for astronomical events.
</p><pre>&lt;ObservatoryLocation id="KPNO"&gt;

    &lt;AstroCoordSystem id="<font color="#9a0301"><i>UTC-GEOD-TOPO</i></font>" /&gt;

    &lt;AstroCoords coord_system_id="<font color="#9a0301"><i>UTC-GEOD-TOPO</i></font>"&gt;
        &lt;Position3D&gt;
            &lt;Value3&gt;
                &lt;C1 pos_unit="deg"&gt;248.4056&lt;/C1&gt;
                &lt;C2 pos_unit="deg"&gt;31.9586&lt;/C2&gt;
                &lt;C3 pos_unit="m"&gt;2158&lt;/C3&gt;
            &lt;/Value3&gt;
        &lt;/Position3D&gt;
    &lt;/AstroCoords&gt;
&lt;/ObservatoryLocation&gt;
</pre>
<h4>3.4.3 Parsing the WhereWhen Element</h4>
<p>
When parsing a VOEvent packet, the following pseudocode may be of
use to provide the time, the right ascension and the declination,
if the author used <i>ICRS</i> spatial coordinates and <i>UTC</i> time.
</p>
<pre>  Let  x =/voe:VOEvent/WhereWhen/ObsDataLocation/ObservationLocation/AstroCoords
  If x[@coord_system_id=&#8216;UTC-ICRS-TOPO&#8217;] then
     Let Time = x/Time/TimeInstant/ISOTime
     Let RA = x/Position2D/Value2/C1
     Let Dec = x/Position2D/Value2/C2
</pre>
<p>
The coordinate system is first checked to verify that it is set
to a specific value(s), <i>UTC-ICRS-TOPO</i>.  In practice, a subscriber may
not care about the difference between <i>ICRS</i> and <i>FK5</i>
(of the order of 0.01") or between <i>TOPO</i> and <i>GEO</i> (in terms of timing,
this is of the order of 25 ms for ground-based and low-earth-orbit observatories).
Software may be written to simply accept anything that contains <i>ICRS</i> or
<i>FK5</i>, <i>TOPO</i> or <i>GEO</i>.
</p>
<h4>3.4.4 Solar Events</h4>
<p>
The following coordinate systems are recognized for solar event data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>UTC-HPC-TOPO</i> - Cartesian helio-projective coordinates (solar disk)</li>
  <li><i>UTC-HPR-TOPO</i> - Polar helio-projective coordinates (coronal events)</li>
  <li><i>UTC-HGS-TOPO</i> - Stonyhurst heliographic coordinates</li>
  <li><i>UTC-HGC-TOPO</i> - Carrington heliographic coordinates</li>
</ul>
<p>
What this means is that these coordinate combinations will be
supported in the library and that, hence, use of VOEvent by the solar
research community is supported.  It does not imply, of course, that
all VOEvent participants are expected to recognize and handle these
solar coordinates - nor, for that matter, that solar subscribers be able
to handle equatorial coordinates.
</p>
<h4>3.4.5 Events Observed from Spacecraft</h4>
<p>
Transient event alerts resulting from observations made on distant spacecraft may
reference coordinates that require correction for ground-based follow-up.  The
precise definition of "distant" will depend on the objects observed, the
instrumentation and the science program.  For remote objects such as gamma-ray
bursts or supernovae, it is likely that spatial coordinates measured from 
spacecraft in Earth orbit will be immediately useful &#8212; indeed, the error box
of the reported coordinates may be much larger than than the pointing accuracy of
the follow-up telescope.  On the other hand, the field of view of the instrument
on that telescope may be many times larger than the error box.  Subscribers must
always balance such concerns &#8212; this is just one facet of matching
"scientific impedance" between discovery and follow-up observations.
</p>
<p>
Even if the spatial targeting coordinates require no correction, the light travel
time may be quite significant between a spacecraft and any follow-up telescopes on
the Earth.  Subscribers may need to adjust wavefront arrival times to suit.
</p>
<p>
Authors of such events may choose to handle reporting the location of the
spacecraft in different ways.  First, they may simply construct the complex
<b>&lt;ObservatoryLocation&gt;</b> element that correctly represents the
rapidly moving location of an orbiting observatory.  Further discussion of
this topic is outside the scope of the present document, see the STC
specification [<a href="#stc">18</a>].  Of course, any subscribers to such an
event stream would have to understand such an <b>&lt;ObservatoryLocation&gt;</b>
in detail and be able to calculate appropriate time-varying adjustments to the
coordinates in support of their particular science program.
</p>
<p>
Alternately, an author of event alert packets resulting from spacecraft observations
might simply choose to correct their observations themselves into geocentric or
barycentric coordinates.  Finally, for spacecraft in Earth orbit, authors might
choose to report an <b>&lt;ObservatoryLocation&gt;</b> such as <i>GEOLUN</i>,
indicating a rough position precise to the width of the Moon's orbit.  These two
options might be combined by both making a geocentric correction &#8212; for instance,
to simplify the handling of timing information &#8212; with the reporting of a
<i>GEOLEO</i> location, for example.
</p>
<h3>3.5 <a id="how" name="how"><b>&lt;How&gt;</b></a> &#8212;
Instrument Configuration</h3>
<p>
The <b>&lt;How&gt;</b> element supplies instrument specific information.
A VOEvent describes events in the sky, not events in the focal plane of
a telescope.  Only specialized classes of event will benefit from
providing detailed information about instrumental or experimental design.
A <b>&lt;How&gt;</b> contains zero or more <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b> elements
(see <a href="#reference">§3.9</a>) 
and <b>&lt;Description&gt;</b> elements, that together characterize 
the instrument(s) that produced the observation(s) that resulted in issuing the VOEvent packet.
A URI pointing to a previous VOEvent asserts that an identical
instrumental configuration was used:
</p>

    &lt;Description&gt; The Echelle spectrograph &lt;/Description&gt;
    &lt;Reference uri="http://nsa.noao.edu/kp012345.rtml" type="rtml" /&gt;

<h3>3.6 <a id="why" name="why"><b>&lt;Why&gt;</b></a> &#8212;
Initial Scientific Assessment</h3>
<font color="red">
<p>
Ask Norman for comment on this section.  How to merge in vocabularies?
How to accommodate new projects with alternate ideas for probability, etc?
How to avoid going all wacky with ontologies?
</p>
</font>
<p>
<b>&lt;Why&gt;</b> seeks to capture the emerging concept of the nature
of the astronomical objects and processes that generated the observations
noted in the <b>&lt;What&gt;</b> element. Natural language words and
phrases are used to express the hypothesized astrophysics, pending a
standard VO ontology or formal UCD-like vocabulary of astronomical
concepts (see [<a href="#ucd">19</a>] and [<a href="#voconcepts">20</a>],
for example). The <b>&lt;Why&gt;</b> element has two optional attributes,
<i><b>importance</b></i> and <i><b>expires</b></i>, providing ratings
of the relative noteworthiness and urgency of each VOEvent, respectively.
Subscribers should consider the <i><b>importance</b></i> and
<i><b>expires</b></i> ratings from a particular publisher in combination
with other VOEvent metadata in interpreting an alert for their purposes.
The publishers of each category of event are encouraged to develop a
self-consistent rating scheme for these values.
</p>
<ul>
<p>
<b>3.6.1 <i>importance</i></b> &#8212; The <i><b>importance</b></i>
provides a rating of the noteworthiness of the VOEvent, expressed as
a floating point number bounded between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). The
meaning of <i><b>importance</b></i> is unspecified other than that
larger values are considered of generally greater importance.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.6.2 <i>expires</i></b> &#8212; The <i><b>expires</b></i>
attribute provides a rating of the urgency or time-criticality of
the VOEvent, expressed as an ISO-8601 [<a href="#iso8601">29</a>]
representation of some date and time in the future. The meaning
of <i><b>expires</b></i> is application dependent but will often
represent the date and time after which a follow-up observation 
might be belated.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
A <b>&lt;Why&gt;</b> element contains one or more <b>&lt;Concept&gt;</b>
and <b>&lt;Name&gt;</b> sub-elements. These may be used to assert
concepts that specify a scientific classification of the nature of
the event, or rather to attach the name of some specific astronomical
object or feature. These may be organized using the
<b>&lt;Inference&gt;</b> element, which permits expressing the nature
of the <b><i>relation</i></b> of the contained elements to the event 
in question as well as an estimate of its likelihood via its
<i><b>probability</b></i> attribute.
</p>
<h4>3.6.3 &lt;Concept&gt; &#8212; classification</h4>
<p>
The value of a <b>&lt;Concept&gt;</b> element uses a controlled
vocabulary to express the hypothesized astrophysics. This standard
VO ontology or formal UCD-like vocabulary of astronomical concepts
vocabulary is still in development (see [<a href="#ucd">19</a>] and
[<a href="#voconcepts">20</a>], for example). 
</p>
<h4>3.6.4&lt;Description&gt; &#8212; natural language</h4>
<p>
This element provides a natural language description of the concept,
either as a replaement for the &lt;Concept&gt; element, or as an
elaboration.
</p>
<h4>3.6.5&lt;Name&gt; &#8212; identification</h4>
<p>
<b>&lt;Name&gt;</b> provides the name of a specific astronomical
object.  It is preferred, but not required, to use standard astronomical
nomenclature, <i>e.g.</i>, as recognized by NED [<a href="#ned">23</a>]
or SIMBAD [<a href="#simbad">24</a>]. 
</p>
<h4>3.6.6&lt;Inference&gt; &#8212; hypotheses inferred</h4>
<p>
An <b>&lt;Inference&gt;</b> may be used to group or associate one
or more <b>&lt;Name&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;Concept&gt;</b> elements.
<b>&lt;Inference&gt;</b> has two optional attributes,
<i><b>probability</b></i> and <i><b>relation</b></i>: 
</p>
<ul>
<p>
3.6.6.1 <b><i>probability</i></b> &#8212; The <i><b>probability</b></i> 
attribute is an estimate of the likelihood of the <b>&lt;Inference&gt;</b> 
accurately describing the event in question. It is expressed as a floating 
point number bounded between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive). In particular, note 
that a <b><i>probability</i></b> of 0.0 can be used to eliminate
<b>&lt;Inferences&gt;</b> from further consideration.
</p>
<p>
3.6.6.2 <i><b>relation</b></i> &#8212; The <b><i>relation</i></b> attribute 
is a natural language string that expresses the degree of connection
between the <b>&lt;Inference&gt;</b> and the event described by the
packet. Typical values might be "associated" - a SN is associated with
a particular galaxy - or "identified" - a SN is identified as corresponding
to a particular precursor star. Such a one-to-one identification is
considered to be the default <b><i>relation</i></b> in the absence of
the attribute.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
This example asserts that the creator of the packet is 100% certain that
the event being described is equivalent to <i>Tycho's Star</i>, which
has been identified as a <i>Type Ia Supernova</i>, and is "associated"
with the <i>SN remnant</i> known as <i>3C 10</i>. This was an important
discovery, but is no longer a very urgent one:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Why importance="1.0" expires="1574-05-11T12:00:00"&gt;
    &lt;Inference probability="1.0"&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;Tycho's Stella Nova&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;Concept&gt;stars.supernova.Ia&lt;/Concept&gt;
    &lt;/Inference&gt;
    &lt;Inference probability="1.0" relation="associated"&gt;
        &lt;Name&gt;3C 10&lt;/Name&gt;
        &lt;Concept&gt;ISM.SNRemnant&lt;/Concept&gt;
        &lt;Description&gt;Supernova remnant&lt;/Description&gt;
    &lt;/Inference&gt;
&lt;/Why&gt;
</pre>
<h3>3.7 <a id="citations" name="citations"></a><b>&lt;Citations&gt;</b> &#8212; 
Follow-up Observations</h3>
<p>
A VOEvent packet without a <b>&lt;Citations&gt;</b> element can be
assumed to be asserting information about a new celestial discovery.
Citations reference previous events to do one of three things: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>follow-up an event alert with more observations or other relevant data, or</li>
  <li>supersede a prior event with better, equivalent information, or</li>
  <li>issue a complete retraction of a previous event.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Citations form the edges of a directed graph whose nodes are VOEvent instances;
they allow merging multiple events into a single related thread, a way to collect multi-sourced
data into a coherent whole.
Projects that implement VOEvent handling may decide to implement for different conditions of 
citation -- perhaps assuming a sparse or structured citation graph, or a small or large arity for each event.

We recommend that the meaning of 'citation' should be a strong one:
<i>if a reader is to understand an event, then the reader should understand the cited event.</i>
This is the relation between a comment and a post, between one observation of a transient and another 
relevant observation. However, not everything should be cited: while the papers of Einstein may be relevant,
they need not be always cited!
A different notion is that of association of sources:
as in a radio source being near an optical source.
If an author wishes to express this notion, 
the <b>&lt;Inference&gt;</b> element can carry this information
(see section 3.6.6).
</p>
<p>
A <b>&lt;Citations&gt;</b> element contains one or more
<b>&lt;EventIVORN&gt;</b> elements. The standard does not attempt
to enforce references to be logically consistent; this is the
responsibility of publishers and subscribers.
</p>
<h4>3.7.1 &lt;EventIVORN&gt; &#8212; Cited event and relationship</h4>
<p>
An <b>&lt;EventIVORN&gt;</b> element contains the IVORN of a previously 
published VOEvent packet. Each <b>&lt;EventIVORN&gt;</b> describes the
relationship of the current packet to that previous VOEvent.
</p>
<p>
An <b>&lt;EventIVORN&gt;</b> element has one required attribute:
</p>
<ul>
3.7.1.1 <i><b>cite</b></i> &#8212; The <b><i>cite</i></b> attribute
accepts three possible enumerated values, <i>"followup"</i>,
<i>"supersedes"</i> or <i>"retraction"</i>. There is no default value. 
</ul>
<p>
The value of the <b><i>cite</i></b> attribute modifies the VOEvent
semantics.  In contrast to a VOEvent announcing a discovery (<i>i.e.</i>,
a packet with no citations), a VOEvent may be explicitly a
<i>"followup"</i>, citing one or more earlier packets &#8212; meaning
that the described real or virtual observation was done as a response
to those cited packet(s). In this case, the supplied information is
assumed to be a new, independent measurement.
</p>
<p>
The <b><i>cite</i></b> may be <i>"supersedes"</i>, which can be used
to express a variety of possible event contingencies. A prior VOEvent
may be superseded, for example, if reprocessing of the original
observation has resulted in different values for quantities expressed
by <b>&lt;What&gt;</b> or <b>&lt;WhereWhen&gt;</b> or if the
investigators have formed a new <b>&lt;Why&gt;</b> regarding the 
event. On the other hand, if a later observation has simply resulted
in different measurements to report, this would typically be issued
as a <i>"followup"</i>. 
</p>
When a citation is made with a "supersede" or "retraction" attribute, it is assumed that 
*all* of the previous information is superseded: and so the cited event is no longer needed. 
If there is datum X and datum Y in the original, and X gets improved calibration, then Y must also be 
copied to the new event, or else its value will no longer be seen.
<p>
A <i>"supersedes"</i> <b><i>cite</i></b> can also be used to merge
two or more earlier VOEvent threads that are later determined to be
related in some fashion. The VOEvents to be merged are indicated with
separate <b>&lt;EventIVORN&gt;</b> elements. The proper interpretation
of such a merger would depend on a VOEvent client having received all
intervening packets from all relevant threads.  Finally,
<i>"supersedes"</i> can be used in combination with a <i>"followup"</i>
to divide a single VOEvent into two or more new threads. First, follow-up 
the event in one packet and then supersede the original event, rather than 
the follow-up, in a second packet (with a second identifier that can start 
a second thread).
</p>
<p>
The <i>"retraction"</i> <b><i>cite</i></b> indicates that the initial
discovery event is being completely retracted for some reason. The
publisher of a retraction may be other than the publisher of the
original VOEvent &#8212; subscribers are free to interpret such a situation
as they see fit.
</p>
<p> Splitting, merging or retracting a VOEvent should typically be
accompanied by a <b>&lt;Description&gt;</b> element discussing why
such actions are being taken.
</p>
<p>
An attempt is made to retract the sighting of Tycho's supernova:
</p>
<pre>&lt;Citations&gt;
    &lt;EventIVORN cite="retraction"&gt;ivo://uraniborg.hven#572-11-11/0001&lt;/EventIVORN&gt;
    &lt;Description&gt;Oops!&lt;/Description&gt; 
&lt;/Citations&gt;
</pre>
<h3>3.8 <a id="description" name="description"><b>&lt;Description&gt;</b></a> 
&#8212; Human Oriented Content</h3>
<p>
A <b>&lt;Description&gt;</b> may be included within any element or
sub-element of a VOEvent to add human readable content.
<b>&lt;Descriptions&gt;</b> may NOT contain <b>&lt;References&gt;</b>.
Users may wish to embellish Description sections with HTML tags such
as images and URL links, and these should not be seen by the XML parser,
as they will cause the VOEvent XML to be invalid against the schema.
However, it is possible to use the CDATA mechanism of XML to quote text
at length, so this may be used for complicated tagged Descriptions. See
the example in section 4 for usage.
</p>
<h3>3.9 <a id="reference" name="reference"><b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b></a>
&#8212; External Content</h3>
<p>
A <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b> may be included in any element or sub-element
of a VOEvent packet to describe an association with external content
via a Uniform Resource Identifier [<a href="#id">16</a>]. 

In addition to the locator for the content, there is also a locator for the meaning of the content,
which is another URI, specified by the 'type' attribute. This can be as simple as a format (eg "fits", "html"),
or something like this: <pre>
type="http://me.edu/myScheme#Eccentricity_Inclination_Covariance"
</pre> where the link leads to a machine-readable description 
of the meaning of the content.

In addition, a local name may be attached to the global resource, so that meaning can be used as a namespace 
in other elements.

A <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b> must be expressed as an empty element,
with attributes only.
</p>
<p>
It is anticipated that VOEvent packets will often include
<b>&lt;References&gt;</b> to such content as finding charts,
cut-out images, light-curves, object catalogs, SQL queries and
instrumental configurations &#8212; to list only a few. This content
will be expressed in various graphics and image formats such as FITS, 
as VOTables [<a href="#votable">22</a>], as RTML
[<a href="#rtml">15</a>] documents, as MIME-typed web content in
general, or as native VOEvents.  </p>

The 'type' of a Reference may also be of higher semantic content, it can be a link to an explanation
of how to read the content and what it means; an explanation that may be targetted to either 
a human or a machine. In this way the semantic web can be connected to the VOEventNet.

<p> A <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b>
element has three attributes:
</p>
<ul>
<p>
<b>3.9.1 <i>uri</i></b> &#8212; The identifier of another document. Should follow URI syntax.
</p>
<p>
<b>3.9.2 <i>type</i></b> &#8212; The type of the document.  Should follow URI syntax.
The default value is <em>"url"</em>. 
</p>
<p>
<b>3.9.3 <i>name</i></b> &#8212; A short, optional name to be used in
descriptive text.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
A <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b> used to provide general purpose ancillary
data with well-defined meaning. 
Here a fits image is presented (h.fits), and also a link to the data model that is needed for
a machine to understand the meaning.

This imaginary event is a brightness measurement of a past supernova
from the RAPTOR [<a href="#raptor">11</a>] telescope.
The <b>&lt;What&gt;</b> section reports a <b>&lt;Description&gt;</b> 
and <b>&lt;Reference&gt;</b> followed by a 
<b>&lt;Param&gt;</b> about seeing and a <b>&lt;Group&gt;</b> with the actual report: the 
magnitude is 19.5, measured 278.02 days after the reference time,
which is reported in the <b>&lt;Wherewhen&gt;</b> section. 
There is a <b>&lt;Table&gt;</b> of measured distances to the presumed host galaxy,
and a <b>&lt;SimpleTimeSeries&gt;</b> of previous magnitude measurements, 
also referred to the reference time.
The packet represents a follow-up observation
of an earlier event, as defined in the <b>&lt;Citations&gt;</b> element.
